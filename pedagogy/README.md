#### 4. Task & Assessment Questions:

Read the theory and comprehend the concepts related to the experiment. [LO1, LO2, LO3]
<br>

Sr. No |	Learning Objective	| Task to be performed by <br> the student  in the simulator | Assessment Questions as per LO & Task|
:--|:--|:--|:--|
1.|Student will be able to :<br>  explain the working and uses of porter governor  | Go through the simulation and perform the experiments to understand the working of the porter governor.  | Q. Governor is attached to the camshaft through<br><u>1)	Bevel gear</u><br>2)	Spur gear<br>3)	Rack and pinion<br>4)	Herringbone gear<br><br>Q. Which one of the following is a Dead weight type governor?<br><u>1)	Porter Governor </u><br>2)	Hartnell Governor<br>3)	Wilson-Hartnell Governor<br>4)	Hartung Governor<br>
2.| Student will be able to calculate the height of the governor with respect of rotational speed  | Perform the experiment in the simulation page for calculation oh height and answer the formative the question in the experiment.  |Q. When the user selects the “Experiment on calculation” and starts the experiment, the user will be asked to calculate the rpm or height or mass arbitrary selected by the simulation of the porter governor. The user will be provided with arbitrary values of mass, height, rpm, and the ratio of FM/BM (from free body diagram). The values will randomize each time the user clicks on the reset experiment. The user will use the generated constant values to calculate the RPM, height, and mass of the porter governor. The user can verify the calculated value putting the value in the checkbox below.<br><br>Q. When the user selects the “Experiment on identifying the parts” and starts the experiment, the user will be asked to identify the parts of the porter governor. The user will be provided with a figure of the porter governor and asked to identify the part name in the drop-down box. The user can verify the correct part name in the checkbox.
3.| Student will be able to examine the variation in the length of the links, length of arms and rotational speed of spindle of the porter governor |Vary the slider causing speed to change. Step by step procedure to be carried out in the experiment. |Q. For the same lift of sleeve, range of speed of proell governor as compared to porter governor is<br>1) Less<br><u>2) More</u><br>3) Equal<br>4) Half<br>5) Double<br><br>Q. If height of the governor increases speed<br><u>1) decreases</u><br>2) increases<br>3) remains constant<br>4) none of above<br>
4.| Student will be able to Note down the minimum and maximum height of governor to its rotational speed and examine the results by plotting the graph.  | Plot the graph with generated data |Q. What is the theoretical correlation between speed and height of the governor?<br><u>1) N<sup>2</sup>∝1/h</u><br>2) N∝1/h<br>3) N<sup>3</sup>∝1/h<br>4) h∝N<br><br>Q. From the simulator, at 160 rpm what is the approximate height of the governor<br>1) 140 mm<br>2) 165 mm<br><u>3) 208 mm</u><br>4) 262 mm<br>
5.| Student will be able to Identify the parts of a porter governor such as flyball, spindle, link, arms, dead weight, sleeve  | List the different Instruments used in the experiment. Explain the significance of each Instrument and its use in the experiment.   |Q. The height of a governor is distance measure from<br>1) the centre of two balls mass<br><u>2) the centre of balls mass to the point of intersection of upper arms</u><br>3) the centre of balls mass to the point of intersection of  lower links<br>4) the point of intersection of upper arms to the point of intersection of  lower links<br>

#### 4. Simulator Interactions:
<br>

Sr.No | What students will do? | What Simulator will do ? | Purpose of the task
:--|:--|:--|:--:
1.| Click on the simulator|	Display the apparatus in different views and free body diagram | Recall the experiment
2.| Change the rpm and notice the change in height of the governor. | Display a speed control pointer ranging from 130rpm to 230rpm | To take the different readings with various inputs.
3.| Click on the button to display graph  | Display the graph of height of governor vs rotational speed and display theoretical correlation formula | To observe graph for change of governor height with change in speed of rotation
4.| Observe graph and write conclusion | Display graph to show change in height of the governor with change in speed of rotation of governor. |To analyse the trend of change in height of the governor with the change in rotational speed of the governor
